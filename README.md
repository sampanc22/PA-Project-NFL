## Project: AI/ML Based NFL Scouting and Draft Simulation

### Objective
To develop a comprehensive AI/ML-based scouting report for NFL draft prospects and simulate the NFL draft. The AI model will analyze team rosters to identify strengths and weaknesses, evaluate and rank upcoming college players, and recommend the optimal player to draft based on a combination of these factors.

### Project Outline
1. **Data Collection**
    - Collect data on NFL teams’ rosters, including player statistics and positions.
        - **Sources:**
            - NFL’s official website
            - Sports reference websites
            - APIs like SportsRadar or MySportsFeeds
    - Gather data on college players declared for the NFL draft.
        - **Sources:**
            - College football’s official website
            - Sports reference websites

2. **Data Analysis**
    - Analyze NFL teams' rosters to identify strengths and weaknesses.
        - Use statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms.
    - Evaluate college players based on their performances and various metrics.
        - Develop a ranking algorithm based on players' statistics and other quantifiable data.

3. **AI/ML Model Development**
    - Develop an AI/ML model that can analyze and predict the “superstar factor” of college players.
        - **Tools & Libraries:**
            - Python
            - Scikit-learn
            - TensorFlow or PyTorch
    - Train the model using historical data of drafted players and their subsequent NFL performances.

4. **Draft Simulation**
    - Use the AI/ML model to simulate the NFL draft.
        - **Tools:**
            - Simulation libraries in Python
            - Custom algorithms to simulate different team’s drafting strategies

5. **Web Application Development**
    - Develop a web application to visualize the results.
        - **Tools:**
            - JavaScript
            - D3.js or Chart.js for visualizations
            - Flask or Django for the backend if needed
